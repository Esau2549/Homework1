            <p>As for my education, I have completed up to Sophmore year in Arizona Western College until recently were I transfered into NAU and this being my first year attending NAU. I haven't have much exposure to the coding world eventhough it is what I am studying but I am definitley looking into getting more action in the industry. While in high school I did to take to trips over to different Universities to study and learn new material as part of the <u>CTY Program</u>. Taking thos trips helps me decide what I wanted to study which is why I decided to get into Computer Science.  </p>
